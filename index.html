      <p>Yam is the common name for some plant species in the genus Dioscorea (family
        Dioscoreaceae) that form edible tubers.[1] Yams are perennial herbaceous vines cultivated for the consumption of
        their starchy tubers in many temperate and tropical regions, especially in West Africa, South America and the
        Caribbean, Asia, and Oceania.[1] The tubers themselves, also called "yams", come in a variety of forms owing to
        numerous cultivars and related species.[1]</p>

      <h2>History of Yam Festivals</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Once upon a time, a severe famine struck an unnamed Igbo land. Plants withered and animals died. The people
        were livid. They pressured their king every day for a solution. Eze Nri, the king, spent many nights awake in
        search of an end to the famine. He was told that he had to kill his children. After killing them, he cut their
        bodies into small pieces before burying them. Six months later, plants grew out of the place where the body
        parts were buried. When Eze harvested them, he found yams and cocoyams. The yams brought the village out of the
        great famine. It is believed this Eze Nriâ€™s dead son is the god of yam, Ahijoku, and Ada, his daughter was the
        cocoyam. Sometimes in Igbo mythology, the yam deity is a goddess called Ahia Njoku. Njoku is represented by the
        yam barns, with an effigy and a shrine.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Yams are the first crops to be harvested and are therefore the most important in Igbo land. Igbo people are
        agrarian by nature and so yam is an important element of their culture. The New Yam Festival, Iwaji is done in
        honor of Ahiajoku (Ajoku, Njoku, Ajokwuji). The word, Iwaji/Iriji means eating yam. The new yam signifies the
        fruitful end to a work year and the beginning of a new one. The practice was said to have begun at the Arochukwu
        community and as time went by, the practice spread around to other Igbo communities. In some places, the
        festival lasts a whole day while in others, the festival extends up until a week. The festival is a celebration
        of the importance of yam in the socio-cultural lives of the people of the community. It was described as the
        crowning ceremony of the year. The new yam is evidence of a good life with accomplishments.
