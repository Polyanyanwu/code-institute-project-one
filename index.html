          Yam is among the edible tubers Yams are perennial herbaceous vines
          cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tubers in many
          temperate and tropical regions, especially in West Africa, South
          America and the Caribbean, Asia, and Oceania (Wikipedia). There are
          various species of yams. Yams are particularly celebrated in the

        <h2>Mythology of Yam Festivals</h2>
        <hr class="full-line">
        <p>
          Once upon a time, a severe famine struck an unnamed Igbo land. Plants
          withered and animals died. The people were livid. They pressured their
          king every day for a solution. Eze Nri, the king, spent many nights
          awake in search of an end to the famine. He was told that he had to
          kill his children. After killing them, he cut their bodies into small
          pieces before burying them. Six months later, plants grew out of the
          place where the body parts were buried. When Eze harvested them, he
          found yams and cocoyams. The yams brought the village out of the great
          famine. It is believed this Eze Nriâ€™s dead son is the god of yam,
          Ahijoku, and Ada, his daughter was the cocoyam. Sometimes in Igbo
          mythology, the yam deity is a goddess called Ahia Njoku. Njoku is
          represented by the yam barns, with an effigy and a shrine.

        <h2>History of Yam Festivals</h2>
        <hr class="full-line">
        <p>
          Yams are the first crops to be harvested and are therefore the most
          important in Igbo land. Igbo people are agrarian by nature and so yam
          is an important element of their culture. The New Yam Festival, Iwaji
          is done in honor of Ahiajoku (Ajoku, Njoku, Ajokwuji). The word,
          Iwaji/Iriji means eating yam. The new yam signifies the fruitful end
          to a work year and the beginning of a new one. The practice was said
          to have begun at the Arochukwu community and as time went by, the
          practice spread around to other Igbo communities. In some places, the
          festival lasts a whole day while in others, the festival extends up
          until a week. The festival is a celebration of the importance of yam
          in the socio-cultural lives of the people of the community. It was
          described as the crowning ceremony of the year. The new yam is
          evidence of a good life with accomplishments.

        <h2>When is the Festival</h2>
        <hr class="full-line">
        <p>
          The New Yam Festival is an annual tradition observed by the Igbo
          People of Eastern Nigeria. In some Igbo communities, the celebration
          lasts a day but in some other communities, it usually takes a week.
          This festival is core to the ancient Igbo culture as the Igbos see
          yam as the king of all crops. To depict its prominence, The Igbos
          observe this festival to thank the gods for a good harvest. At
          Mbaise in Imo State it is celebrated on the 15 August of every year.

        <hr class="image-intro-line">
        <p>Igbos are found in the South Eastern part of Nigeria. A description of the Igbos given by Britannica.com is
          well apt and sumarised below: Most Igbo traditionally have been subsistence farmers, their staples being yams,
          cassava, and taro. The other crops they grow include corn (maize), melons, okra, pumpkins, and beans. Among
          those still engaged in agriculture, men are chiefly responsible for yam cultivation, women for other crops.
          Land is owned communally by kinship groups and is made available to individuals for farming and building. Some
          livestock, important as a source of prestige and for use in sacrifices, is kept.
          <br><br>The principal exports are
          palm oil and palm kernels. Trading, local crafts, and wage labour also are important in the Igbo economy, and
          a high literacy rate has helped many Igbo to become civil servants and business entrepreneurs in the decades
          after Nigeria gained independence. It is notable that Igbo women engage in trade and are influential in local
          politics.</p>
