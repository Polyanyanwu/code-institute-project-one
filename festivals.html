        Yams are the first crops to be harvested and are therefore the most
        important in Igbo land. Igbo people are agrarian by nature and so yam
        is an important element of their culture. The New Yam Festival, Iwaji
        is done in honor of Ahiajoku (Ajoku, Njoku, Ajokwuji). The word,
        Iwaji/Iriji means eating yam. The new yam signifies the fruitful end
        to a work year and the beginning of a new one. The practice was said
        to have begun at the Arochukwu community and as time went by, the
        practice spread around to other Igbo communities. In some places, the
        festival lasts a whole day while in others, the festival extends up
        until a week. The festival is a celebration of the importance of yam
        in the socio-cultural lives of the people of the community. It was
        described as the crowning ceremony of the year. The new yam is
        evidence of a good life with accomplishments.
